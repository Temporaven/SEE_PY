|--------------------------------|------------|
| Convert the R codes into Python codes (use Jupyter Notebook). | Incomplete |
| Using simulated data, perform the Sessa Empirical Estimator and generate some insights. | Incomplete |
| The Sessa Empirical Estimator uses K-Means clustering; try to substitute a different clustering algorithm and generate a new insight using the new clustering algorithm. | Incomplete |
| Compare your results between the Sessa Empirical Estimator using K-Means and the Sessa Empirical Estimator using the clustering algorithm of your choice. | Incomplete |
| Create a callable function in each step. Check if these callable function has the same result (and insights) with your Jupyter Notebook. | Incomplete |
